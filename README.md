This repository's sole purpose is to host the practical work done as part of the Java Technologies course included in the Master's Degree program, Software Engineering branch first year semester 1. Additional pieces of information over this course's requirements, as well as details, can be found [here](https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~acf/tj/).

Each laboratory has its associated folder with an additional file README.md used to describe the steps involved in implementing the solution.
