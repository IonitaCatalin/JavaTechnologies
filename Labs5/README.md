1. ✔️Rewrite the persistence layer of the application created for the previous laboratory
	-  ✔️ Define the  _persistence unit_  using a  _data source_  configured as a JDBC Resource.
	 -  ✔️ Create the  _EntityManager_  objects using dependency injection.
	- ✔️ Define the mappings using JPA-only annotations.
	- ✔️ Implement the repository classes using  **JPA-QL**.
	- ❌ Create a test unit for the CRUD operations of at least one entity class

2. ❌ Exams can be of various types, for example _written test_, _project presentation_, etc, each having specific properties, such as _bibliography_ or _required resources_, etc. Define at least two type of classes representing _exams_. Use inheritance mapping in order to define this new model. Adapt the user interface accordingly.

4. ✔️ Add an _"exam search page"_. This page will allow specifying various filters: exam name, a student name, a time, etc.
	 -  ✔️ Each filter will have a checkox - if it is checked then the filter will be taken into consideration.
	 -  ✔️ The query must be implemented using  **JPA Criteria API**.
