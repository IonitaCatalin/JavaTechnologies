# **Requirements**


1.  (3p) Add security features to the application created in the previous lab, using standard mechanisms offered by Java EE for:
    
    -   Authentication, using a JDBC Realm;
    -   Controlling the access to Web resources, using Web constraints;
    -   Securing the business logic components and REST services.
    
      
    
2.  (2p) Expose a CRUD REST resource from the previous lab as a **microservice**.
    -   Run the microservice using an Eclipse Microprofile server implementation (Payara Micro, Open Liberty, Quarkus, etc.)
    -   Create an additional microservice that will invoke the first one.
    -   Create Docker containers for the microservices. Consider deploying the database also as a container.
